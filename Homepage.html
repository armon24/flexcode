            <h1>Welcome to Mentor Match!</h1>
            <h2>What we do:</h2>
            <p>
                Advice from teachers and advisors is great but sometimes we need to hear the real deal. Lets face it, faculty and staff
                don't always know (or can't tell you) who are the best teachers and which classes are harder than others. Also when it 
                comes to balancing school and a social life, their advice falls flat. 

                That's where we come in!

                We will match you with another student with similar academic and social interests as you so that you can get the real information.
                Your mentor will be able to answer all those questions that teachers and advisors just can't! And upperclassman, this is your chance
                to pass down all that knowledge you wish you'd known! 
            </p>
